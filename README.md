# Guidelines for Managing Software Developers in a Team

Managing a team of software developers can be challenging, especially for startups that are still finding their rhythm and hire devs quickly. One of the biggest struggles that I have been facing as a founding engineer, architecture designer, and product manaher was making sure that new developers quickly adapt to the team's workflow and contribute effectively without causing disruptions. To help navigate these challenges, I've put together a set of guidelines based on my own experience that can help streamline the development process and foster collaboration within the team. I will share it in a compact way with you so I hope it help you out:


## Development Guidelines

### Branch & PR Management:

- Always create a new feature branch from the latest deploy branch

- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feature/x-validation)

- Keep branches focused on single features/fixes

### Pull Request Requirements:

- Create detailed PRs with clear descriptions

- List all major changes and their impact

- Add screenshots/examples when relevant

- Request reviews from appropriate team members

### Testing and Documentation:

- Write unit tests for all new functions

- Add clear function comments

- Maintain Existing Codebase:

- Avoid modifying existing functionality

- Add features without changing core logic

- Document any necessary changes to existing code

### New Feature Implementation:

- Implement new features as separate services when possible

- Use microservice architecture for independent features

### Dependency Management:

- Don't update dependencies unless absolutely necessary

- Test thoroughly if dependencies must be updated

- Document any dependency changes and their impact

- Create separate PRs for dependency updates

## Why These Guidelines Matter

 I wrote this guideline based on my own experience working from large corportate and small startup as founding engineer or arhcitecture designer and product manaher.. I made this guideline to create a consistent workflow that helps both new and existing devs work effectively. By following these practices, teams can reduce confusion, minimize errors, and maintain high code quality. It also helps to form a the development process more predictable and scalable, which is important for startups looking to grow quicly and onboarding new members.
